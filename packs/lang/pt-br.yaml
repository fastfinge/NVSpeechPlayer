normalization:
  replacements:
    # eSpeak pt-br emits "y" for the raised final "e" (roughly like [i~ɪ]).
    # But after nasal "ã" it behaves like a glide (mãe, pães).
    - from: "ãy"
      to: "ãj"
    - from: "y"
      to: "i"

    # eSpeak pt-br often uses "æ" for word-final unstressed "a" (casa, feira).
    # Map it to a central a-like vowel so it doesn't sound like English "cat".
    - from: "æ"
      to: "a"

    # In Brazilian Portuguese, "r" in clusters and word-final is closer to a tap.
    - from: "r"
      to: "ɾ"
