  replacements:
    # eSpeak Polish uses the palatalization marker ʲ on consonants.
    # Convert it to an audible /j/ glide so it doesn't get dropped.
    - from: "ʲ"
      to: "j"

    # Some eSpeak outputs use plain 'y' for /ɨ/.
    - from: "y"
      to: "ɨ"

    # eSpeak Polish reduces many unstressed /a/ to ɐ, but Polish doesn't really
    # do vowel reduction like that. Keep it as a clearer /a/.
    - from: "ɐ"
      to: "a"

    # eSpeak writes Polish cz/dż as tʃ/dʒ (which default.yaml turns into t͡ʃ/d͡ʒ).
    # Polish cz/dż are typically retroflex t͡ʂ/d͡ʐ.
    - from: "t͡ʃ"
      to: "t͡ʂ"
    - from: "d͡ʒ"
      to: "d͡ʐ"

    # eSpeak approximates Polish retroflex sibilants using ʃ/ʒ.
    # Map them to Polish-style ʂ/ʐ to better match the language.
    - from: "ʃ"
      to: "ʂ"
    - from: "ʒ"
      to: "ʐ"
